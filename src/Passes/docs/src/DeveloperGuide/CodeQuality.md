# Code quality and continuous integration

## Using the manage tool

Before making a pull request with changes to this library, please ensure that style checks passes, that the code compiles,
unit test passes and that there are no erros found by the static analyser.

To setup the CI environment, run following commands

```sh
source develop.env
virtualenv develop__venv
source develop__venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These adds the necessary environment variables to ensure that you have the `TasksCI` package and all required dependencies.

To check the style, run

```sh
./manage stylecheck
```

To test that the code compiles and tests passes run

```sh
./manage test
```

Finally, to analyse the code, run

```sh
./manage lint
```

You can run all processes by running:

```sh
./manage runci
```

As `clang-tidy` and `clang-format` acts slightly different from version to version and on different platforms, it is recommended
that you use a docker image to perform these steps. TODO(TFR): The docker image is not added yet and this will be documented in the future.

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, you first need to build the library. Assuming that this is already done and the corresponding build is in `Debug/`, run the tests from the `Debug` folder:

```
lit tests/ -v
-- Testing: 2 tests, 2 workers --
PASS: Quantum-Passes :: QirAllocationAnalysis/case1.ll (1 of 2)
PASS: Quantum-Passes :: QirAllocationAnalysis/case2.ll (2 of 2)

Testing Time: 0.27s
  Passed: 2
```

The C++ test suite can also be ran from the debug by first building all targets:

```sh
cmake ..
make
```

and then running following command:

```sh
ctest
```

## Writing C++ tests

TODO(tfr): Write this section

## Modifying code quality requirements

This component is the largest part of this PR. The continuous integration component includes:

1. Style formatting to ensure that everything looks the same. This includes checking that relevant copyrights are in place.
2. Static analysis
3. Unit testing

The automatic style enforcement is configurable with the ability to easily add or remove rules. Currently the source pipelines are defined as:

```python
SOURCE_PIPELINES = [
    {
        "name": "C++ Main",
        "src": path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "Source"),

        "pipelines": {
            "hpp": [
                require_pragma_once,
                enforce_cpp_license,
                enforce_formatting
            ],
            "cpp": [
                enforce_cpp_license,
                enforce_formatting
            ]
        }
    },
    # ...
]
```

This part defines pipelines for `.hpp` files and `.cpp` files allowing the developer to add such requirements such as having copyright in the op of the source file and ensure that formatting follows that given by `.clang-format`.

Each of these CI stages can executed individually using `./manage` or you can run the entire CI process by invoking `./manage runci`. An example of what this may look like is here:

```zsh
./manage runci

2021-07-21 14:38:04,896 - FormatChecker - ERROR - /Users/tfr/Documents/Projects/qsharp-compiler/src/QsPasses/src/OpsCounter/OpsCounter.cpp was not correctly formatted.
2021-07-21 14:38:04,899 - FormatChecker - ERROR - Your code did not pass formatting.

The key idea here is to make it extremely easy to be complaint with the style guide, correct any issues that might come as a result of static analysis and at the same time enforce this when a PR is made.

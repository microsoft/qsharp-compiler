# Microsoft Quantum Development Kit Preview for .NET6

This is a **preview version** of the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit extension for Visual Studio based on .NET6.0 components.

We're actively working on supporting .NET6.0 in our VS Code extension. This support is still under development and this extension should be considered experimental.

You can find here our currently supported extension [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode).

## Getting Started

To jump right in, take a look at our [Getting Started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-get-started-qdk) to learn about the structure of a Q# project and how to develop a quantum program with Q#.

You can also try our [Quantum Computing Fundamentals](https://aka.ms/learnqc) learning path to get familiar with the basic concepts of quantum computing, build quantum programs, and identify the kind of problems that can be solved.

**NOTE: The simulator included with the Quantum Development Kit requires a 64-bit operating system to run.**

The source code for this extension can be found on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler).

## Support and Q&A

If you have questions about the Quantum Development Kit and the Q# language, or if you encounter issues while using any of the components of the kit, you can reach out to the quantum team and the community of users in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/q%23) and in [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/q%23) tagging your questions with **q#**.

## Feedback

Your feedback about all parts of the Quantum Development Kit is important. Please go to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler) to provide feedback on the Q# compiler and language extensions, or to learn more about where to give feedback on other parts of the Quantum Development Kit.

## Components and Documentation

The Quantum Development Kit preview provides a complete development and simulation environment.
Refer to [our documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum) for further information on the Quantum Development Kit and its [components](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/overview-what-is-qsharp-and-qdk).

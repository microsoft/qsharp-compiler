# Microsoft Quantum Development Kit Preview for .NET 6

This is a **preview version** of the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit extension for Visual Studio based on .NET 6.0 components.

The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit extension supporting .NET 6.0 is under active development and should be considered experimental.

To use the currently supported extension, see [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode).

**NOTE: It is not supported to have both versions of the extension installed side by side.**

## Getting Started

To jump right in, take a look at our [Getting Started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-get-started-qdk) to learn about the structure of a Q# project and how to develop a quantum program with Q#.

You can also try our [Quantum Computing Fundamentals](https://aka.ms/learnqc) learning path to get familiar with the basic concepts of quantum computing, build quantum programs, and identify the kind of problems that can be solved.

**NOTE: The simulator included with the Quantum Development Kit requires a 64-bit operating system to run.**

The source code for this extension can be found on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler).

## Support and Q&A

If you have questions about the Quantum Development Kit and the Q# language, or if you encounter issues while using any of the components of the kit, you can reach out to the quantum team and the community of users in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/q%23) and in [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/q%23) tagging your questions with **q#**.

## Feedback

Your feedback about all parts of the Quantum Development Kit is important. Please go to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler) to provide feedback on the Q# compiler and language extensions, or to learn more about where to give feedback on other parts of the Quantum Development Kit.

# Microsoft Quantum Development Kit Preview

Thank you for your interest in Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio preview. 
The Quantum Development Kit contains the tools you'll need to build your own quantum computing programs and experiments. 
Assuming some experience with Visual Studio, beginners can write their first quantum program, and experienced researchers can quickly and efficiently develop new quantum algorithms.

To jump right in, take a look at our [Getting Started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/csharp?view=qsharp-preview). Use [Quickstart - your first computer program](http://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quantum-WriteAQuantumProgram) to learn about the structure of a Q# project and how to write the quantum equivalent of "Hello, world!" --  a quantum teleport application.

**NOTE: The simulator included with the Quantum Development Kit requires a 64-bit operating system to run.**

The source code for this extension can be found on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler). 

## Feedback

Your feedback about all parts of the Quantum Development Kit is important. Please go to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler) to provide feedback on the Q# compiler and language extensions, or to learn more about where to give feedback on other parts of the Quantum Development Kit.
 
## Components and Documentation

The Quantum Development Kit preview provides a complete development and simulation environment.
We refer to [our documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/?view=qsharp-preview#quantum-development-kit-documentation) for further information on the Quantum Development Kit and its [components](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/#microsoft-quantum-development-kit-components).

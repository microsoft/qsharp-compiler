# Generating QIR

This project contains an example for how to use the Q# compiler to emit QIR in human readable form.
For more information about QIR and the features, please see this [readme](../../../src/QsCompiler/QirGeneration/README.md).

This project compiles using a *released* version of the compiler and QIR generation. If you intend to develop/modify the QIR generation and/or the compiler, please take a look at the [Development project](../Development) instead, which is compiled using the source code version of the compiler and QIR generation.

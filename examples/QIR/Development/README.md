# Development of the QIR Generation Logic

This project is intended for trouble shooting the [QIR generation](../../../src/QsCompiler/QirGeneration). The Q# project in this folder is compiled using the source code version of the Q# compiler and the QIR generation; any changes to them will be reflected in the emitted QIR.

This is *not* how the QIR generation is meant to be used if you don't intend to modify the source code for it. Please see the [Emission project](../Emission) for how to use a shipped version of the compiler and QIR generation.

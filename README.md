# Microsoft Quantum Development Kit: <br>Q# Compiler and Language Server #

Welcome to the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit!

This repository contains the Q# compiler included in the [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/), 
as well as the Q# language server included in our [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit) and our [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode).
For more information related to the language server protocol take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol).
These extensions provide the IDE integration for Q#, and can be found on this repository as well.  

The Q# compiler provides a [command line interface](./src/QsCompiler/CommandLineTool). For further information on how to use Q# binaries take a look at the [README](./src/QsCompiler/CommandLineTool/README.md) in that folder.

## New to Quantum? ##

See the [introduction to quantum computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/concepts/) provided with the Quantum Development Kit.

## Installing the Quantum Development Kit

**If you're looking to use Q# to write quantum applications, please see the instructions on how to get started with using the [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/) including the Q# compiler, language server, and development environment extensions.**

Please see the [installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide) for further information on how to get started using the Quantum Development Kit to develop quantum applications.
You may also visit our [Quantum](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum) repository, which offers a wide variety of samples on how to write quantum based programs.

## Building from Source ##

Before you can build the source code on this repository and start contributing to the Q# compiler and extensions you need to run the PowerShell script [bootstrap.ps1](./bootstrap.ps1) to set up your environment. 
We refer to the [PowerShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) for instructions on how to install PowerShell. 
The script in particular generates the files that are needed for building based on the templates in this repository. 

The Q# compiler and language server in this repository are built using [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/). 
For instructions on how to build and debug the Visual Studio Code extension take a look at [this file](./src/VSCodeExtension/BUILDING.md). 
Building and debugging the Visual Studio extension requires Visual Studio 2019. Open [the corresponding solution](./VisualStudioExtension.sln) and set the [QsharpVSIX project](./src/VisualStudioExtension/QsharpVSIX/) as startup project, then launch and debug the extension as usual. 
The Visual Studio extension is built on the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) that comes with Visual Studio 2019. Alternatively you can easily obtain it via the Visual Studio Installer. 

We recommend uninstalling any other Q# extensions when working on the extensions in this repository.  

### Tips for using VSCode ###
This repository includes both C# and F# code, as well as .csproj and .fsproj projects organizing that code. The recommended extensions for interacting with these language types are the [Microsoft C# extension powered by OmniSharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) and the [Ionide FSharp extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp). Several of the projects in each language express dependencies on the other language, which can cause errors resolving namespaces even when the builds succeed without errors. To resolve these errors in C# projects that depend on F# resources, ensure the the MSBuild utilized by Omnisharp comes from an install of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Community edition with support for F# installed. To resolve errors loading .csproj files in the Ionide extension, use the "Change Workspace or Solution" option in the F#: Solution Explorer to select the top level "qsharp-compiler" folder. This will allow Ionide to find only the .fsproj projects instead of trying to load both .csproj and .fsproj listed in the solution files.
